## Shiny Application Introduction

The shiny application was produced by using the R package [Shiny]( https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for the one of assessment in ETC5523 course, which is an interactive webiste application by updating user inputs. The application can be run on the [remote host](https://xitong-he.shinyapps.io/shiny-assessment-xhee0013).

The main motivation behind this simple shiny app is designed to interactively visualize the situation of COVID-19 cases in three countries such as Australia, China and United Kingdom from January to September and provide a platform for performing and reviewing the change of cases distribution for each regions in all countries across time. All data used by this application are collected through `coronavirus` package which is from [RamiKrispin GitHub repo](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus). The coronavirus dataset consists of measurements of case distribution between countries and regions across time, therefore it will be used and constructed a series of analysis to evaluate the situation of COVID-19 pandemic.
