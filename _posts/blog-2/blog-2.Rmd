Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became global epidemics and threaten human life now. On Jan 27, 2020, the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Germany, was informed of the first human case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a German national working for a company in the greater Munich area @bohmer2020investigation.\

In this blog, I am going to analyse the situation of COVID-19 in Germany.\

## Data description

The `germany_region` cleaned data is obtained from [GitHub nevrome](https://github.com/nevrome/covid19germany), where is provided a tidy format dataset with PKI timeseries about COVID-19 cases and deaths for Germany (timeseries) pandemic outbreak and the raw data is collectd by[NPGEO Corona](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/search?groupIds=b28109b18022405bb965c602b13e1bbc). In addition, the `germany` data is from R package `coronavirus`[@coronavirus] provided by [RamiKrispin](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus), which contains COVID-19 data from 188 countries or regions, and the raw data collected and arranged by [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 

The two datasets are shown as below:\

-  **germany** - daily summary of the outbreak on the national level\

-  **germany_region**- daily summary of the outbreak on the region level\


These two datasets is collected the information from 2020-01-27 until now, updating daily by daily data information. \


```{r read-data}
germany_total<-covid19germany::get_RKI_timeseries()
x<-covid19germany::group_RKI_timeseries(germany_total)
data("coronavirus")
germany <- coronavirus %>% 
  filter(country=="Germany", date >= "2020-01-27")%>%  
  select(-province) %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date, label = TRUE))
```
